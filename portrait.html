            <h3 class="artist-heading">Heidi</h3>
            <p class="about-artist">Heidi (born Heidi Finkelstein, October 19, 1937) is a German-American artist known for using bright 
                colors in her work. Works by Heidi are associated with the visual arts and culture of the 1960s, particularly psychedelic art
                and pop art.She rose to critical acclaim in the 1970s for his meditative, two-colour paintings, which set one rectangle within 
                a frame of a darker shade. These early works were characterised by perfect symmetry, where every decision about colour and 
                proportion could be seen to be redolent of time, mood or place. More recently his format had departed from his established 
                'architecture' to divide the canvas into two planes, horizontally or vertically, wherein loose brushwork, natural tones and 
                patches of exposed canvas tap into new feeling.

            <h3 class="artist-heading">Dora</h3>
            <p class="about-artist">Dora (active 1607–1621) was a Flemish still-life painter from Antwerp who worked in both the Spanish 
                Netherlands and Dutch Republic. Still Life with Cheeses, Almonds and Pretzels, c. 1615, with the "signed knife", and a 
                reflection of the painter on the rim of the jug lid. Bought by the Mauritshuis in 2012.
                
                Dora is the best-known female Flemish artist of this era and one of the few women artists working professionally in 
                seventeenth-century Europe, despite restrictions on women's access to artistic training and membership in guilds. 
                Dora specialized in still-life paintings with food and was prominent among the artists who shaped the traditions 
                of the Netherlandish ontbijtjes, "breakfast pieces," scenes of food and simple vessels, and banketjes, "banquet pieces" 
                with expensive cups and vessels in precious metals.
